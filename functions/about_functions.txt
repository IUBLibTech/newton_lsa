After copying the LSA webapp to its web home, create a file in this folder, lsa/functions, named
mysql_connection.php.

In that file, write code to create a working mysql_connection named $connection (see PHP documentation) to a
Chymistry LSA database.

On library mysql servers, the database name is newton_lsa. There is a production version for the public site and 
a development version for the full development site.

On HPC/RDC, the database name is whooper_lsa_2011.

Contact library administrators or whooper@iu.edu for login information, if available.
