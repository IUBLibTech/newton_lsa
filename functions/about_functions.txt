After copying the LSA webapp to its web home, create a file in this folder, lsa/functions, named
mysql_connection.php.

In that file, define the PHP variable $textSite with the web address of the Chymistry xproc P5 digital edition
where this installation of the component can links its own side-by-side displays to the digital edition's versions of
the same texts.

In that same file, also write code to create a working mysql_connection named $connection (see PHP documentation) to a
Chymistry LSA database with a statement that looks like:

$connection = new mysqli($host.$port, $user, $passwd, $db);    (Notice that I joined $host and $port and added the colon to $host.)

On library mysql servers, the database name is newton_lsa. There is a production version for the public site and 
a development version for the full development site.

On HPC/RDC, the database name is whooper_lsa_2011.

Contact library administrators or whooper@iu.edu for login information, if available.
