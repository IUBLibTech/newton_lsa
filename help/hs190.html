<meta name="description" content="Isaac Newton, like Albert Einstein, is a quintessential symbol of the human intellect and its ability to decode the secrets of nature. Newton wrote and transcribed about a million words on the subject of alchemy, of which only a tiny fraction has today been published. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chymistry of Isaac Newton hosted by Indiana University's Digital Library Program, is producing a scholarly online edition of Newton's alchemical manuscripts integrated with new research on Newton's chymistry." />

        <h1>Graph for NWB</h1>
        <p>This output format is designed to create network graphs
          for use in the Network Workbench (NWB) application, which&nbsp;
          can be downloaded by following the link on the results page. </p>
        <p><IMG SRC="NWB splash.jpg" BORDER="0"></p>
        <p>LSA searches can produce hundreds of results. A natural and
          intuitive way to work with large LSA result sets is to put them
          into network graphs to visualize connections and clusters. </p>
        <p>This option is available for Document-document, Chunk-chunk,
          and Term-term searches. </p>
        <p>NWB allows you to use the mouse to explore the graph and its
          Pyhon programming interface allows you to modify colors, sizes,
          and shapes according to defined properties in the graph files. </p>
        <p>See NWB documentation for help with its tools.</p>
        <p>This example shows part of the network of related passages for <I>Keynes MS. 21, "The Method of the Work."</I></p>
