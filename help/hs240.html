<meta name="description" content="Isaac Newton, like Albert Einstein, is a quintessential symbol of the human intellect and its ability to decode the secrets of nature. Newton wrote and transcribed about a million words on the subject of alchemy, of which only a tiny fraction has today been published. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chymistry of Isaac Newton hosted by Indiana University's Digital Library Program, is producing a scholarly online edition of Newton's alchemical manuscripts integrated with new research on Newton's chymistry." />

        <p>This scope option only returns result pairs if both members
        (i.e. both chunks or both terms) are part of the query set
        selected by the user.
        </p>
        <p>This allows users to view only the connections between the
        particular documents or terms they're interested in.
        </p>
        <p>This option excludes results from all chunks and terms not in the
        query set, even if their correlation values are greater than the
        chosen correlation level.
        </p>
        <p>This option is only available for Document-document searches
        and Term-term searches. It is not available for Chunk-chunk
        searches.
