<meta name="description" content="Isaac Newton, like Albert Einstein, is a quintessential symbol of the human intellect and its ability to decode the secrets of nature. Newton wrote and transcribed about a million words on the subject of alchemy, of which only a tiny fraction has today been published. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chymistry of Isaac Newton hosted by Indiana University's Digital Library Program, is producing a scholarly online edition of Newton's alchemical manuscripts integrated with new research on Newton's chymistry." />

        <h1>All w/Term Presence (Term-Doc)</h1>
        <p>This scope option is only available for Term-chunk,
        Chunk-term, Query with Terms, and Query with
        Chunks searches. It is available for the CSV
        XY-charts.
        </p>
        <p>When the LSA component returns results for these
        searches using this scope option, it will report
        the correlation value and whether or not the term
        is actually present in the chunk.
        </p>
        <p>Terms will frequently have strong term-chunk correlations
        with locations where the term is not present. Words belong
        to semantic networks and LSA Term-chunk correlations
        actually detect the presence of the word's semantic network.
        </p>
        <p>This is potentially very interesting for investigating the
        difference that terms make in their contexts.
        </p>
        <p>To suppress chunks where terms are not present,
        use <A HREF="hs270.html">Only if Term Present (Term-Doc)</A>
        instead.
