<meta name="description" content="Isaac Newton, like Albert Einstein, is a quintessential symbol of the human intellect and its ability to decode the secrets of nature. Newton wrote and transcribed about a million words on the subject of alchemy, of which only a tiny fraction has today been published. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chymistry of Isaac Newton hosted by Indiana University's Digital Library Program, is producing a scholarly online edition of Newton's alchemical manuscripts integrated with new research on Newton's chymistry." />

        <h1>Summary of Steps in the Query Procedure</h1>
        <ol class="genericList">
        <li> Select a <B>Search Type</B> and select a <B>Chunk Size</B> of 250 words
        or 1000 words</li>
        <li>Select a <B>Results Output Type</B>.</li>
        <li>Constrain the scope of the search with <B>Return Scope of Pairs</B>.</li>
        <li><B>Build a Query Set</B>. Add documents, chunks, or terms to a
        Query Set using built-in drop-down lists. The term query interface also&nbsp;
        provides a Regex tool to select terms, which helps with linguistic inflections.</li>
        <li><B>Execute the search</B>. Choose a threshhold level of correlation and
        then run the search. The correlations are reported as cosines similarities.
        Pairs of documents or terms are more highly correlated as the cosine value
        approaches 1.0.
       </li>
        <li><B>Work with the List of Results</B>. When lists of document results are
        returned, click on the links provided to view the chunks. Shared significant
        vocabulary is highlighted in the viewing interface. Links to the edited document
        in the digital corpus are included at the top of the chunks.</li>
        <li><B>Clear the Query</B> to start over. </li>
