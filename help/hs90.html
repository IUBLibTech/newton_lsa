<meta name="description" content="Isaac Newton, like Albert Einstein, is a quintessential symbol of the human intellect and its ability to decode the secrets of nature. Newton wrote and transcribed about a million words on the subject of alchemy, of which only a tiny fraction has today been published. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chymistry of Isaac Newton hosted by Indiana University's Digital Library Program, is producing a scholarly online edition of Newton's alchemical manuscripts integrated with new research on Newton's chymistry." />

      <h1>Chunk-Term correlations</h1>
      <p>Chunk-Term correlations provide information about which terms
      are significant in a given chunk with respect to the rest of the corpus.
      </p>
      <p>For instance, if two chunks have a strong chunk-chunk correlation,
      then their chunk-term correlations should reveal which terms and networks
      underpin their relationship.
      </p>
      <p>The user can construct a query that works in a similar way.
