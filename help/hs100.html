<meta name="description" content="Isaac Newton, like Albert Einstein, is a quintessential symbol of the human intellect and its ability to decode the secrets of nature. Newton wrote and transcribed about a million words on the subject of alchemy, of which only a tiny fraction has today been published. With the support of the National Science Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chymistry of Isaac Newton hosted by Indiana University's Digital Library Program, is producing a scholarly online edition of Newton's alchemical manuscripts integrated with new research on Newton's chymistry." />

        <h1>Query with Terms</h1>
        <p>Instead of using the built-in correlation searches, users can construct
        and run their own queries by selecting terms from the term list.
        </p>
        <p>The LSA component treats the user's list as a mini-document and
        searches for chunks that correlate with it. A user query with terms will
        return correlated chunks and report which terms are present in those chunks.
        </p>
        <p>This is similar to the Term-Chunk correlatiion search. See <A HREF="hs80.html">Term-Chunk correlations</A></p>
        <p>Because the query string will be much shorter than 250 or 1000 words, use a lower correlation value when running the search.
